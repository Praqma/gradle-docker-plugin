/**
 * Helper class used to parse json objects from a stream where one json object follows the next.

 * When a closing curly bracket is followed by an opening curly bracket it is assumed that a json object ends, and a
 * new starts. This is good enough for what is needed, but not a general solution, e.g. doesn't handle arrays, and the pair
 * could be in a string literal.
 * <p>
 * The class will split an underlying stream in sub-stream, one per json object. The method nextStream() is used
 * to advance to the next json object.
